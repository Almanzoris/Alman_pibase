As shown in {{mathse:3812324}}.

Note first that any closed subspace of a compact is itself compact. If the space is Hausdorff, then every compact set $K$ in the space is closed, see <https://math.stackexchange.com/q/83355>.

So then let $K$ be the given compact neighborhood of a point $x$ in a weakly locally compact Hausdorff space, and let $\mathcal B$ be a basis of open neighborhoods of $x$. Then $\mathcal B'=\{cl(B\cap K):B\in\mathcal B\}$ is a basis of closed neighborhoods of $x$. Since each $cl(B\cap K)\subseteq cl(K)=K$ , $\mathcal B'$ is a basis of compact neighborhoods, showing that a weakly locally compact Hausdorff space is strongly locally compact.
