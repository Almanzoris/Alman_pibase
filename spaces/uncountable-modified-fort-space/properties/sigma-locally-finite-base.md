Let \(\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} B_n\) be a base (which we write as the countable union of families \(B_n\)). Each singleton of \(Y\) is open, and so must appear among the \(B_n\). Since \(Y\) is uncountable, some \(B_k\) contains infinitely-many singletons. Now, any open set containing the point \(a\) misses only finitely-many points, so its intersection with \(B_k\) is infinite. Therefore, the space cannot have a \(\sigma\)-locally finite base.
